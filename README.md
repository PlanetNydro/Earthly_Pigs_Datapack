With the 1.21.11 update, we have some new features!

Grey Llama Reskin:
Due to the lack of support for custom llama variants, and the similarity between the grey and white llama textures, the grey llama has been retextured to resemble the Jolly Llama.

Interdimentional Cows:
- Moon Cow: originating from the 23w13a_or_b snapshot, the moon cow can be found wandering the Outer End islands. While they don't still walk backwards or have their fancy helmets, they still have their unique loot table. There's a new advancement for anyone who can feed one in the saftey of the Overworld.
- Magma Cow: comming from some unused Minecraft Earth concept art, the Magma Cow can be found wandering the Basalt Deltas. Their rocky skin keeps them safe from the flames of the Nether, causing them to drop basalt and steak when slain. Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure cows need access to the sky to spawn, so I'm not sure if they can spawn at all.

Items:
- Cheese: resembling end stone, this food item is dropped by moon cows. It replenishes the same ammount of hunger as steak, albeit with less saturation, providing an alternate source of food in the end.
- Fancy Feather: dropped by fancy chickens, this special feather exists to remind everyone that yes, they are in fact, better than you. It has no unique functionality from a regular feather.
- Jolly Carpet: crafted with a green carpet and a sweet berry, this carpet can be used to give your llamas the unique festive carpet design of the original jolly llama. When placed, it reverts to a regular green carpet.
- Bucket of Mud: crafted with an empty bucket and either 8 dirt or one mud block, the bucket of mud is exactly what you'd expect. It can be placed like a normal mud block, or it can be used on a temperate pig, turning it into a muddy pig. Either way, you get your empty bucket back.

Configuration Menu:
There is now a config menu on the pause screen! This way, you can toggle some of the features in this datapack however you wish! While this menu will show up for all users in the world, the buttons should only work if you have access to commands.
- Flower Cow Shearing: by smacking a Moobloom or a Moolip with a pair of shears, you can turn them back into a temperate cow, much like how you can with mooshrooms. When sheared, they leave behind a dandelion or pink tulip, respectively. They should be healed afterwards, unless, of course, you kill them.
- Wooly Cow Shearing: by smacking an umbra or wooly cow with a pair of shears, you can shear them like a sheep. Umbra cows drop black wool, while wooly cows drop brown. After a few minutes, their wool should grow back. As with the flower cows, they should be healed after you hit them... as long as they still have their wool when you do.
- Responsive Muddy Pigs: causes the mud on muddy pigs to interact with their enviroment. Their mud will dry out in warm biomes. Once dried out, they can be returned to their normal state by having them stand on mud or muddy roots. Standing on these blocks will also prevent them from drying out in the first place. Finally, they can have their mud washed off entirely by going for a swim, reverting them to temperate pigs.
- Check Current Settings: this button lets you check what the previous three settings are at the moment. I would have liked to make their status visible in the config menu itself, but if there's a way to do that, I have no idea how.


Technical Changes:
Most variants work in a way that SHOULD allow them to accept biomes from other mods/datapacks, as far as I can tell.
I don't know enough about how diffrent datapacks interact, especially when it comes to loot tables and world generation, to be able to say if some of the behind-the-scenes stuff in this datapack could interfere with others. I tested a couple and it seemed to be safe, but I'm listing the relevant information just in case.
- Chicken, cow and wolf loot tables have been altered
- Chicken egg laying loot table has been altered to include all new variants. Gold Crested and Skewbald chickens lay normal eggs, Amber and Bronzed chickens lay warm eggs, Midnight and Stormy chickens lay cold eggs, and Fancy chickens have a chance to lay any of them. Cluckshrooms are off doing their own thing laying red mushrooms.
- Animals can now spawn on mycelium, basalt, and end stone
- Wolves can now spawn on sand
- Basalt Deltas world generation has been altered so cows can spawn in groups of 1-2 (...theoretically)
- Deserts world generation has been altered so wolves can spawn in groups of 1-2
- End Highlands, End Midlands, and Small End Islands world generation have been altered so cows can spawn in groups of 1-4
- Mushroom Fields world generation has been altered so chickens can spawn in groups of 4
- Pale Gardens world generation has been altered so pigs can rarely spawn in groups of 4
- Snowy Plains world generation has been altered so cows and pigs can spawn in groups of 4
